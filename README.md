# GymBuddy Mobile Application

Social Media application for gym-related content.

## Overview
- Many social media apps have users for gym content, but it is often drowned-out by other posts
- This app is for users interested specifically in gym advice and motivation, getting rid of general social media content to focus specifically in a single area
- By removing other content and addin features specifically to promote fitness and nutrition, people can better track their exercises and share with/learn from others

## My Role
**Type:** Team project (4 members)

### My Contributions
- Developed login/signup/update account features so users can store and change account information
- Implemented Android Room Database to hold local information
- Added camera access to emulation to create a more realistic experience for users

## Tech Stack
- Frontend/Backend: Kotlin
- Database: Android Room Database

## Key Features
- Login/Sign up for users to hold account information
- Posting feature for users to share workouts, sets, reps, and cardio with others
- Streak feature to promote daily exercise

## Challenges & Learnings
- Challenges revolved around lack of communication with other team members to have a clear vision of the project
- Learned how to better communicate with team members and delegate tasks to each individual

## Running the Project
Clone the project into Android Studio and run in an emulator via the 'run' button:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TGrim-03/GymBuddy
